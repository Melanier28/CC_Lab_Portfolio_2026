  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>

    For this project, I worked in a group of three to create a digital exquisite corpse creature. Each of us drew a character, divided it into three parts (head, body, legs), and then exchanged sections. My task was to take the mismatched pieces I received and recreate the full creature in code.

One of the biggest challenges was getting the face to look right—translating hand-drawn shapes into code took a lot of trial and error. Placing coordinates was also extremely tedious, and small adjustments often required re-checking the layout several times.

Through this process, I learned how important careful positioning is when drawing with code, and how creative collaboration can lead to surprising, funny, and unexpected results.
