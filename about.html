  <h1>About Me</h1>


  <h2>Education</h2>

  <p>I am from the Bronx, New York, and currently attend The New School. My education has given me the opportunity to explore a variety of subjects, with a particular focus on creative arts and technology. Being in the city has exposed me to diverse ideas and ways of thinking, which I try to bring into all of my projects.</p>


  <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>

  <p>I enjoy coding, digital art, and designing interactive projects. I like experimenting with p5.js to create generative art, as well as exploring games and interactive storytelling. Outside of coding, I enjoy drawing, listening to music, and finding inspiration from the world around me.</p>


  <h2>Career Goals</h2>

  <p>I am interested in pursuing a career in software engineering, particularly in areas where creativity and technology intersect. I hope to develop interactive applications, games, or creative software that combine design, storytelling, and programming.</p>


  <h2>Reflections on Technology & Coding</h2>

  <p>

    Technology and coding are central to my creative practice. I enjoy using code not just as a tool, but as a medium to express ideas, visualize concepts, and experiment with interactivity. The Internet has also been a valuable resource, allowing me to learn new skills, collaborate with others, and share my projects with a wider audience. Coding challenges push me to problem-solve creatively and refine my skills continuously.
