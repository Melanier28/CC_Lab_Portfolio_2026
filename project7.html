  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>

    For this project, I created an autobiographical game where players walk through different scenes inspired by memories from my life. Each area represents a moment and moving through the game becomes a way of retracing my personal story. One of the biggest challenges was getting collisions to work properly. Sometimes the player could walk through objects or not trigger an event I wanted to happen, and it took a lot of trial and error to make sure boundaries were accurate and movement felt smooth. Adjusting coordinates, hitboxes, and interactions for each scene was tedious but taught me a lot about careful game design.
