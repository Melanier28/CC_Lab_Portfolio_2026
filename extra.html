  <h2>Reflections</h2>

  <p>

    Throughout this class, I learned a great deal about combining creativity with technology. I gained hands-on experience with coding, digital art, and interactive projects, which taught me how to translate ideas into visual and interactive experiences. Working on assignments like my autobiographical game and the exquisite corpse project challenged me to think critically about design, collaboration, and problem-solving in code.
I also learned the importance of iteration, testing, debugging, and refining my work, which showed me that creativity is as much about experimenting and learning from mistakes as it is about producing a final product. Collaborating with classmates and sharing feedback helped me see different approaches to problem-solving and inspired me to try new techniques.
Overall, this class strengthened both my technical skills and my creative confidence. I feel more comfortable using coding as a tool for expression and storytelling, and I now have a stronger foundation to pursue future projects in software engineering and interactive design.
