  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>

    When I finished coding the flower, I was surprised by how slowly the petals moved. At first, it felt almost funny. In my mind, a second always feels like it passes instantly. But seeing it represented visually, as the petals rotated one step at a time, completely changed my perception. This assignment allowed me to see time in a way I hadn’t before. A second isn’t just a blink, it’s a measurable and visual moment when you slow down and pay attention. Designing an unconventional clock helped me realize how flexible and creative timekeeping can be. Clocks don't have to be rigid or mechanical, they can be expressive. Mapping seconds to motion, choosing colors, and experimenting with shapes pushed me to think both logically, since it took a lot of trial and error to get the coordinates right, and creatively. Overall, this assignment helped me deepen my understanding of time, code, and visual storytelling.
